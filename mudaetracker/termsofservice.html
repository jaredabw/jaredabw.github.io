            By using the Bot (Mudae Tracker), you agree that you will use the Bot fairly without causing disruptions to other users.<br>
            If you or a server you are in are abusing the Bot, you may lose access for a period of time.<br>
            At times, data may be lost or corrupted. There are no guarantees about the stability of data, but in cases where this occurs, backups are available.<br>
